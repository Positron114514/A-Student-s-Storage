I recommend a novel called "run away" by Alice Munro, which tells the story of Carla, the protagonist, who escapes twice in her life. The first time is from the no feeling family, with the parents despise Clark, who will be her husband in the future, to pursue a "more real life". On their first days of her “run away”, they would often go to some tavern bar to taste a few specials and then drive home singing. But it wasn't long before all this romantic life came to be seen as a waste of time and money. The hardships of life, Clark's very bad temper, especially Clark's despicable idea of "wanting to blackmail the neighbor" make Carla run away again. But on the bus to Toronto, her courage to face life alone gave way to fear as she got off the bus ,crying, and called Clark, as the home she knew and the city she didn't know got closer.
Run away is not just a novel of female consciousness, but a novel that explores the eternal theme of female growth. It is not only a reproduction of rural life in western Canada, but also a profound exploration of the universal sense of human nature.
